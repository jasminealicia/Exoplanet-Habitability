# Exoplanet-Habitability
Binary classification project for Bay Path University's ADS 635 Data Mining I class. The goal was to build models that would accurate predict whether an exoplanet was habitable or not. As I continue to learn more, I wish to come back to this project and fix any mistakes I missed and optimize the code.


Langauges utilized in this project: R
Machine Learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines. Attempted Logistic regression but came across "complete separation" issue - explained in my video!
